# Research_Assistant
Here are a few practical examples of the codes I wrote in my research assistant job. Due to confidentiality, I can only share the codes without the data.

This research is related to homelessness across 16 years of data. The codes are written to extract data from multiple sources, transformed in an analyzable way, and exported into excel files & worksheets the necessary data for further statistical analysis. Below is a more in-depth description of the two files in this repository:

- Part 1:
This file is focused on some data cleaning, creating Nodes and Links charts across each year from networking analysis, calculating the number summary of networking analysis ("Size", "Density", "Components", "Diameter", "Clustering Coefficient"), and auto-saving graphs into png format to desired location.

- Part 2:
This file focused on extracting data from multiple sources, then recording important information across each year and state. First, I wrote codes that read data such as (1) the HUD funding data, which I collected online, (2) homelessness data, (3) governor data, which I created, and (4) median income data, which I collected from the U.S. Census Bureau. Then, I record critical information that will be used further and compare some necessary changes in the research. Last, I save the data frames across different years and export them as an Excel file, with different spreadsheets for each year.
